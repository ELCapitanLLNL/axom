## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Adds ability to configure Axom (in particular Sidre and Spio) without hdf5. 
- Adds a Point-In-Cell query to Quest. The Point In Cell query finds the cell
  in a computational mesh that contains an arbitrary point in space.
  If such a cell exists, it also finds the isoparametric coordinates of the 
  point with respect to the cell. The query supports higher order
  mfem meshes (mfem.org).
