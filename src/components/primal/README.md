PRIMAL: Geometric primitives and associated computational geometry tests {#primaltop}
========

Primal provides several useful geometric primitive types (e.g. Point, BoundingBox, Triangles)
and several computational geometry tests on these primitives (e.g. intersection, proximity, orientation).

It also provides spatial acceleration data structures over collections of spatial objects (e.g. bounding volume hierarchy, uniform grid)
