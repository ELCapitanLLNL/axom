Generating figures
==================

The figures that accompany each of the code snippets in the first example
are generated in this way:

1. Run the primal first example binary in this directory.  This generates
   several Asymptote source files with extension `.asy`.
2. Compile each source file to PNG format with Asymptote.  For example, run
   `asy -f png showClip.png`.

Asymptote (see http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/) is a vector drawing package.
Despite having its main project page on sourceforge.net, the actual source
repository is on github, where development continues apace.
