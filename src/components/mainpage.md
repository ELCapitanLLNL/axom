Axom {#mainpage}
================

Axom provides libraries that address common computer science needs.  It grew from the recognition that physics codes at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories had encountered the need for logging, a data store, geometric computation, file I/O, and other facilities and had addressed the needs in various idiosyncratic methods.  Axom is designed to provide a drop-in replacement for code that wants to adopt it.
