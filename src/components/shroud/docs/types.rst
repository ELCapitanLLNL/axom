Types
=====

The wrappers generated by Shroud will make sure the argument types are
compatible between Fortran and C++. For the most common types there is
no work necessary since Fortran 2003 provides interoperability with C
via the iso_c_binding module.

Other types, such as logical and in particular strings, require additional
conversions.

                            '{c_var} = {f_var}  ! coerce to C_BOOL',
                            ],

                        # The wrapper is needed to convert bool to logical

                        ),
