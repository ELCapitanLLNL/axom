CS Toolkit User Quick Start Guide
=========================================================

This guide provides information to help CS Toolkit users get up and
running quickly. Specifically, it describes:

  * CS Toolkit dependencies on third-party libraries and how to build and 
    install those libraries
  * How to configure, build, and install the CS Toolkit libraries
  * How to compile and link an application with the CS Toolkit

Additional information aboout the CS Toolkit build system and user guides
for Toolkit components can be found by following links on the 
`main CS Toolkit documentation page <https://lc.llnl.gov/toolkit/docs/sphinx/web_docs/html/index.html>`_.

We maintain two email lists: 'asctoolkit-dev@llnl.gov'
(mainly for developer communication) and 'asctoolkit-users@llnl.gov'
(for developer-user interaction). If you want to communicate with the 
CS Toolkit team or other users, go to the
`LLNL E-Mail List Manager Site <https://lists.llnl.gov>`_ to subscribe to
these lists.

We also have a chat room on Cisco Jabber called 'CS Toolkit Dev'. It's open
to anyone. You just have to log on to Jabber and join.
