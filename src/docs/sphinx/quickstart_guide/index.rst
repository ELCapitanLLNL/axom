CS Toolkit Quick Start Guide
=========================================================

This guide provides information to help CS Toolkit users and developers get 
up and running quickly. It describes how to obtain, build and install
third-party libraries that the Toolkit depends on, how to configure,
build and install the CS Toolkit libraries, and how to compile and link
an application with the Toolkit. Additional information aboout the CS Toolkit,
including its build system, user guides for Toolkit components, developer
guides, and source code documentation can be found by following links on the 
`CS Toolkit Web Page <https://lc.llnl.gov/toolkit/docs/sphinx/web_docs/html/index.html>`_.

There are multiple ways to communicate with the team if you have questions,
suggestions, etc. We maintain two email lists: 'asctoolkit-dev@llnl.gov'
(mainly for developer communication) and 'asctoolkit-users@llnl.gov'
(for developer-user interaction). If you want to communicate with the 
CS Toolkit team or other users, go to the
`LLNL E-Mail List Manager Site <https://lists.llnl.gov>`_ to subscribe to one
or both of these lists.

We also have a chat room on LLNL Cisco Jabber called 'CS Toolkit Dev'. It's 
open to anyone. You just have to log on to Jabber and join the room.
