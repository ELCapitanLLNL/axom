CS Toolkit Quick Start Guide
=========================================================

This guide provides information to help CS Toolkit users and developers get 
up and running quickly.

It describes how to do the following:

  * Obtain, build and install third-party libraries that the Toolkit depends on
  * Configure, build and install the CS Toolkit component libraries
  * Compile and link an application with the Toolkit

The following additional information about the CS Toolkit, can be found here
`CS Toolkit Web Page <https://lc.llnl.gov/toolkit/docs/sphinx/web_docs/html/index.html>`_:

  * Build system
  * User guides for individual Toolkit components
  * Developer guides
  * Source code documentation

There are multiple ways to communicate with the team if you have questions,
suggestions, etc. We maintain two email lists:

    * 'asctoolkit-dev@llnl.gov' - developer communication
    * 'asctoolkit-users@llnl.gov' - developer-user interaction

If you want to communicate with the CS Toolkit team or other users, go to the
`LLNL E-Mail List Manager Site <https://lists.llnl.gov>`_ to subscribe to one
or both of these lists.

We also have a chat room on the LLNL Cisco Jabber called 'CS Toolkit Dev'. It's 
open to anyone. You just have to log on to Jabber and join the room.
