ASC Toolkit
===========

The principle goal of the Toolkit is to provide a collection of
computer-science focused software components that can be shared by
LLNL simulation code projects.  In particular, the Toolkit will
support:

  *  Next-generation ASC multi-physics simulation codes that target advanced computing platforms
  *  Current production ASC and other LLNL code efforts and as they continue to evolve
  *  LLNL research codes, proxy apps, etc.
