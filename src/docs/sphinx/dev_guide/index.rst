Axom Developer Guide
=========================================================

This guide describes the main software development processes used
in the Axom project. The guide is intended for all team members and 
contributors. It is especially helpful for familiarizing individuals
with how the team works. Our goal is to establish simple development
practices that are easy for all contributors to understand and follow.
We believe that when everyone on the team follows similar practices, this
helps to ensure that our code will be robust, consist, correct, and easy to 
use. Everyone who contributes to Axom should be aware of and follow these 
guidelines. 

We realize that the benefits of uniformity are best balanced with 
allowances for individual preferences, which may work better in 
certain situations. Therefore, our processes should not be viewed as fixed 
for all time. They should evolve with project needs and be improved when 
processes can be improved. Changes should be agreed to by team members after 
assessing their merits using their collective professional judgment. When 
changes are made, this guide should be updated accordingly.
