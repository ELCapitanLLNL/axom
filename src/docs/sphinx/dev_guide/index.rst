CS Toolkit Developer Guide
=========================================================

This guide describes key aspects of the software development process for
the CS Toolkit project and provides a set of coding guidelines used by
the team. The guide is meant for all team members and contributors, and
is especially helpful for "on-boarding" new team members and contributors. 
The aim is that all code in the CS Tookit is developed following similar 
practices to ensure that it is robust, consistent, easily understood and used, 
and tested and documented well. Anyone who contributes to the CS Toolkit 
should be aware of and follow these guidelines. 

The guidelines should not be viewed as fixed for all time. They should evolve 
with project needs and be improved when there are better ways of doing things. 
Changes should be agreed to by team members after assessing their merits using 
their collective professional judgment. When changes are made, this guide
should be updated accordingly. Also, the benefits of uniformity should be 
balanced with allowances for individual preferences, which may be 
superior in certain situations.
