Axom Developer Guide
=========================================================

This guide describes key aspects of the software development processes used
in the Axom project. The guide is intended for all team members and 
contributors. It is especially helpful for familiarizing new individuals
about how the team works. The overarching goal is that all Axom
development follows similar practices to ensure robustness, consistency,
ease of use, and comprehensive testing. Everyone who contributes to 
Axom should be aware of and follow these guidelines. However, the
benefits of uniformity should be balanced with allowances for individual 
preferences, which may be superior to rigid conventions in certain situations.

Our processes should not be viewed as fixed for all time. They should evolve 
with project needs and be improved when processes can be improved. Changes 
should be agreed to by team members after assessing their merits using 
their collective professional judgment. When changes are made, this guide
should be updated accordingly.
