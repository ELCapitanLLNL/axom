CS Toolkit Developer Guide
=========================================================

This guide describes key aspects of the software development process and
provides a set of coding guidelines for the CS Toolkit project. The guide
is meant for all team members and contributors, especially for "on-boarding"
new team members and contributors. The aim is that all code in the CS Tookit
is developed following similar practices to ensure that it is robust, 
consistent, easily understood and used, and tested and documented well. 
Anyone who contributes to the CS Toolkit should be aware of and follow 
these guidelines. 

The guidelines should not be viewed as static; they should evolve with
project needs and improved when there are better ways of doing things. 
Changes should be agreed to by the core development team after assessing their
merits based on the teams collective professional judgment. Also, the 
benefits of uniformity should be balanced with allowances for individual 
stylistic preferences, which may be superior in certain situations. 
When changes are made, these guidelines should be updated accordingly.
