Axom Developer Guide
=========================================================

This guide describes the main software development processes used
by the Axom project. It is intended for all team members and contributors. 
and is especially helpful for new individuals who wish to understand how 
the team works. We employ simple practices that are easy for all contributors 
to understand and follow. We believe that when everyone on the team follows 
similar practices, it helps to ensure that our code will be robust, consist, 
correct, and easy to use. Everyone who contributes to Axom should be aware 
of and follow these guidelines. 

We realize that the benefits of uniformity should be balanced with 
allowances for individual preferences, which may work better in 
certain situations. Therefore, we do nnot view these processes as fixed 
for all time. They should evolve with project needs and be improved when 
it makes sense. Changes should be agreed to by team members after 
assessing their merits using our collective professional judgment. When 
changes are made, this guide should be updated accordingly.

.. note:: This document does not describe how to configure and build the
          Axom code, or how to use it. For that information, please follow 
          the links to the Quickstart Guide and component user documentation 
          on our `Main Web Page <../../web_main_docs/html/index.html>`_
