Building the Code (BLT)
--------------------------

The `Axom Quickstart Guide <../../../quickstart_guide_docs/html/index.html>`_ 
describes how to build the Axom code and its third-party library dependencies.

The Axom build system is built on top of a streamlined CMake-based build 
system foundation, called *BLT*, that we maintain and share with other 
software projects. It is available in the 
`BLT GitHub Project <https://github.com/LLNL/blt>`_. BLT provides a "common 
sense" CMake setup that helps to simplify configuration and building the Axom 
code. It also enables software development tool integration via *make targets*. BLT has built-in support for the following tools, all of which we use for 
Axom development:

  Documentation
    *Doxygen* (source code docs) and *Sphinx* (user docs)
  Unit testing
    *CTest* (test orchestration), *Google Test* (C/C++ unit tests), *Fruit* (Fortran unit tests)
  Code Health
    *Uncrustify* (code style), *gcov* and *lcov* (code coverage), and *Valgrind* (memory checking)
  Benchmarking
    *Google Benchmark*

We use `Spack <https://github.com/LLNL/spack>`_ to manage and build the 
third-party libraries on which Axom depends.
