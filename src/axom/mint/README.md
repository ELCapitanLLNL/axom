Mint: Mesh data model {#minttop}
============

[Mint](@ref axom::mint) is a C++ library that provides:

#. A comprehensive  [mesh](@ref axom::mint::Mesh) data model that can support
   structured, unstructured and particle mesh discretizations.

#. A mesh-aware, fine-grain, parallel execution model that underpins the development of
  computational tools and numerical discretization methods, enabling
  implementations that are born *parallel* and *portable* to new and emerging
  architectures.

The [Mint User Guide](https://axom.readthedocs.io/en/develop/axom/mint/docs/sphinx/index.html)
introduces these concepts in more detail.
