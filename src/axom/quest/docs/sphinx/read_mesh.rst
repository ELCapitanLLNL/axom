Reading in a mesh
*****************

Applications commonly need to read a mesh file from disk.  Quest provides the 
STLReader class, which can read binary or ASCII STL files, as well as a parallel
PSTLReader class.  STL (stereolithography) is a common file format for triangle
meshes.

Insert example and discussion here.
