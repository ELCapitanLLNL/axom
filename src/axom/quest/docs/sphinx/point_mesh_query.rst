Point queries against a mesh
****************************

Quest provides three queries to test a point against a mesh: in/out, distance field,
and point-in-cell.

Insert examples and discussion here for in/out and distance.  These work with 
a 3D point and a surface mesh.

Insert examples and discussion here for point-in-cell.  This works with a 3D
(or 2D?) point and a mesh of the same dimension.
