Check and repair a mesh
***********************

In a perfect world, meshes generated by other tools
or read in from disk would be valid and ready for use.  More frequently, a
mesh needs some kind of cleanup.  Quest provides functions to check a mesh 
for common errors.  As well, the STL file format specifies triangles without
de-duplicating the vertices.  Quest provides a function to "weld" vertices 
within a distance of some specified epsilon.

Insert example and discussion here.
