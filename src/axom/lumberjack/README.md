Lumberjack: Log filtering and aggregation {#lumberjacktop}
========

[Lumberjack](@ref axom::lumberjack) provides functionality to filter log events based on priority, rate, and volume.  It coordinates with but does not require the [SLIC](@ref slictop) component.

The [introduction to Lumberjack](../../../sphinx/axom_docs/html/axom/lumberjack/docs/sphinx/index.html)
covers these concepts in more detail.
